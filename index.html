          <strong>Fats</strong>
          <p>Fat is a type of nutrient. You need some fat in 
             your diet but not too much. Fats give you energy 
             and help your body absorb vitamins. Dietary fat 
             also plays a major role in your cholesterol levels.</p>

          <strong>Carbohydrates</strong>
          <p>Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along 
             with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of three 
             main nutrients found in foods and drinks.Your body 
             breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or 
             blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your 
             body's cells, tissues, and organs. Glucose can be 
             used immediately or stored in the liver and muscles 
             for later use.

          <strong>Protein</strong>
          <p>Protein is in every cell in the body. Our bodies 
              need protein from the foods we eat to build and 
              maintain bones, muscles and skin. We get proteins 
              in our diet from meat, dairy products, nuts, and 
              certain grains and beans. Proteins from meat and 
              other animal products are complete proteins. This 
              means they supply all of the amino acids the body 
              can't make on its own. Most plant proteins are 
              incomplete. You should eat different types of plant 
              proteins every day to get all of the amino acids 
              your body needs.

            <strong>Calories</strong>
            <p>Calories are essential for human health. The key is 
            consuming the right amount.Everyone requires different 
            amounts of energy each day, depending on age, sex, size, 
            and activity level.People in the United States consume 
            more than 11 percent of their daily calories from fast food.
            Foods high in energy but low in nutritional value provide 
            empty calories.</p>
